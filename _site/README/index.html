<h1>RaysWhetherWeather</h1>
<p>This project is a weather webpage which utilies the Bulma css framework, Eleventy(11ty), Netlify and versioning via GitHub.<br>
The Github repo for this webpage can be found at https://github.com/ERayBre/RaysWhetherWeather</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is ran and tested localy using 11ty serve and pushed to GitHub via Visual Studio, then pulled by Netlify to host the webpage.<br>
Started by creating a local folder as a repository.<br>
Linked this with vsCode and then Github.<br>
Insalled NPN and 11ty and started 11ty serving from this location.<br>
Linked this local repo to a new GitHub repo to allow for push etc.<br>
created a new project in Netlify and linked it with Github, specifying the site directory as the one to publish.<br>
Templating was achieved by way of 11ty nunjucks, this also allowed for generation of data from json files.</p>
<p>Limitations were hit during deployment of the project as Netlify had credits limits on the deployment of the project, I paused the deployment opting for manual push of the deployment once the credit limit was alomost reached.</p>
