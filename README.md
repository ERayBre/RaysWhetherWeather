## Reflection
Started by creating a local folder as a repository  
Linked this with vsCode and then Github  
Insalled NPN and 11ty and started 11ty serving from this location    
Linked this local repo to a new GitHub repo to allow for push etc  
created a new project in Netlify and linked it with Github, specifying the _site directory as the published one
