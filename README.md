# RaysWhetherWeather
This project is a weather webpage which utilies the Bulma css framework, Eleventy(11ty), Netlify and versioning via GitHub.\
The Github repo for this webpage can be found at https://github.com/ERayBre/RaysWhetherWeather
 
## Reflection
>The project is ran and tested localy using 11ty serve and pushed to GitHub via Visual Studio, then pulled by Netlify to host the webpage.\
>Started by creating a local folder as a repository.\
>Linked this with vsCode and then Github.\
>Insalled NPN and 11ty and started 11ty serving from this location.\
>Linked this local repo to a new GitHub repo to allow for push etc.\
>created a new project in Netlify and linked it with Github, specifying the site directory as the one to publish.\
>Templating was achieved by way of 11ty nunjucks, this also allowed for generation of data from json files.
> 
>Limitations were hit during deployment of the project as Netlify had credits limits on the deployment of the project, I paused the deployment opting for manual push of the deployment once the credit limit was alomost reached.
